### Adding person
Persons can be added through the Web UI. This process is asycronous and transmitts the payload to a back-end Azure Funciton which in turn persists the entity.

To find more information, seach for "addperson" in Application Insight.


### Escalation Required
This is a critical issue and must be investigated promptly.
