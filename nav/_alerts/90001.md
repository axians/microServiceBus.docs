### Following steps should be taken when troubleshooting an offline node alert
1. Go to mSB and check the audit log on the alerting node. Your can easily see if someone is currently working with this node as it logs a diff when node is being worked on.

*If someone is currently working with a node, send them a message and tell them to set the node to maintainance mode in mSB while working.*

2. If no technician is working on the alerting node, next step is trying to access the node through diffrent commands.
3. Click the Identifiers tab of the node properties page.

4. Copy the ICCID number (Highlighted in the blue circle from the image above)

### Cmder/Terminal (Connected to Vattenfall Jump Gateway)
9. Check if the alerting node is reachable by pinging the ipaddress If there is no response from the node, escalate the ticket to axians-vf slack channel.
10. Try connecting to the node via the ssh command “ssh admin@ipaddress”
11. Enter the password from the node properties page. If ssh connection does not work, escalate the ticket to axians-vf slack channel.
12. Try the following commands to get mSB running again. See below command table.

    | Device Type        | Command | Comment |
    | -------------- |-------------|-------------|
    | Raspberry PI	| sudo systemctl stop/start/restart microservicebus-node	Stop/Start/Restart the mSB-node service
    | Raspberry PI	| systemctl status microservicebus-node	Checking status of the mSB-node service
    | Raspberry PI	| sudo reboot	Rebooting the RPi device
    | Dell (Ubuntu snap) | snap list | Lists all snaps on the node
    | Dell (Ubuntu snap) | sudo snap stop/start/restart microservicebus-node | Stop/Start/Restart the mSB-node snap
    | Dell (Ubuntu snap) | sudo reboot | Rebooting the Dell GW

13. If the node comes successfully online, close the ServiceNow ticket with a short close note of what solved the issue. If the node still not comes online, escalate to axians-vf slack channel including a short summary of taken steps.
