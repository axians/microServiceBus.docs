### Invalid user login
This ticket is generated when a login attempt with a non-existing username is made. This typically happens due to misspelling. Could also be a security risk where someone is trying to login as user root without the account existing on the node. 


### Escalation Required
Tickets with failed login are escalate directly to customers through default escalation process. Ask if anyone tried to login using the information from the ticket.
