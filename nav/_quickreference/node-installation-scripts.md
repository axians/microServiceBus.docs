Node installation scripts can optionally be used to install the **microservicebus-node** agent on a device. There are two versions of the scripts targeting Linux and Windows based devices. 

Running the scripts will install node.js if needed and proceed with downloading and installing the **microservicebus-node** agent. 

The scripts require a set of parameters which are generated at runtime, and are therefor not particularly useful to use outside the scope of creating a device. The content of the scripts can be downloaded here:
